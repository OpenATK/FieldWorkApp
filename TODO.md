- Dont make operation a rev'd link inside a field.
  - Instead watch the /operations? Maybe im doing that already and just don't need the rev'd link
  - Is there a way we can remove 'operation' form field in tree, but still create a link to it when i push a new field?
    - I don't want it to pull down the operation when i do the initial get (supply a different tree to get???)
